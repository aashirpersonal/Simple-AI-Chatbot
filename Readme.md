Project Overview:

This project is a simple AI chatbot implemented in Python.
The chatbot uses regular expressions to match user input to predefined patterns and provides appropriate responses.
It demonstrates basic natural language processing and pattern matching techniques.

Key Features:

Pattern-Response System: The chatbot has a set of predefined patterns and corresponding responses. It searches for these patterns in the user's input and returns a random response if a match is found.
Regular Expressions: The chatbot uses regular expressions (regex) to allow for flexibility in pattern matching. This enables the bot to handle variations in user input.
Continuous Interaction: The chatbot engages in a continuous conversation with the user until the user types 'quit' to end the interaction.

Benefits:

Demonstrates your understanding of basic AI concepts like natural language processing and pattern matching.
Shows your ability to implement a working AI chatbot using Python.
Provides a starting point for more advanced chatbot projects.

You can further enhance this project by adding more patterns and responses, implementing a more sophisticated NLP technique, or integrating it with a web framework for a user-friendly interface.
